### ZOOTR Analysis

This repository contains two main scripts that are designed to collect spoiler log data from ZOOTR (Ocarina of Time Randomizer) generated seeds, and set them up for dynamic searching 
- 'handler.py' - runs the main OoTRandomizer.py script a set amount of time, then collects the data in specific folders and converts into python classes & dataframes
- 'analyzer.py' - a playground for generating analytic insights, including distributions and seed-scoring methods

This system requires tweaking the output logs of the base ZOOTR environment slightly. Contact me if interested in using these scripts.
